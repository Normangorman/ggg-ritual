# We Will Remember
A game for global game jam 2016 at the university of york

A village hero is tasked by his village's elder to complete a series of unpredictable tasks.
However, as the hero proceeds to complete their quests, they realize that the nature of these quests is less and less noble,
and the elder's true nature begins to unfurl.

The style is that of a top-down action game, similar to Zelda. Quests must be completed in a preset amount of time without dying -
these are conditions for losing.
